#  Football Match Outcome Prediction

This project predicts the result of football matches (Win/Draw/Loss) using **Logistic Regression** on historical match data.

##  Dataset
- Features include `HomeTeam`, `AwayTeam`, `FTR` (Full-Time Result), goals, shots, fouls, etc.
- Dataset: `Football.csv`



##  Tools Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib



##  Model Details
- Model: Logistic Regression
- Preprocessing: Label Encoding, Train-Test Split
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report



##  Results
- ~92% accuracy
- Custom input support for match prediction



##  How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Colab
2. Upload `Football.csv`
3. Run cells to train and test the model
